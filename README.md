# C# Text Encryptor with GUI
<p>This project is a user-friendly text encryption and decryption application built using C# and the .NET Framework. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily encrypt plain text and decrypt encrypted text. It also provides the option to change the encryption hash, offering flexibility and security for different use cases.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>

  <h3>Text Encryption:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter a plain text string, and the program will encrypt it using the selected encryption hash algorithm.</li>
        <li>The encrypted text is displayed in the GUI for easy copying and sharing.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Text Decryption:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter the encrypted text, and the program will decrypt it back to its original plain text format.</li>
        <li>Supports seamless decryption for both simple and complex encrypted strings.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Customizable Encryption Hash:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The program allows users to change the encryption hash algorithm (e.g., SHA-256, MD5, etc.).</li>
        <li>Changing the encryption hash alters the encryption format, adding an additional layer of flexibility to the program.</li>
        <li>This feature enables users to experiment with different encryption methods or select the one most suitable for their security needs.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>User-Friendly GUI:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The graphical interface is designed to be intuitive and simple to use.</li>
        <li>No coding experience is required to use the application, making it accessible for both beginners and advanced users.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Security and Flexibility:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>By providing the option to select different encryption algorithms and easily switch between them, the program offers flexibility in securing sensitive data.</li>
        <li>The tool can be used for various purposes, such as securing personal messages, testing different encryption methods, or understanding how different hashes affect encryption formats.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>C#</strong>: The primary programming language for building the application.</li>
        <li><strong>.NET Framework</strong>: Used for the development of the application and GUI.</li>
        <li><strong>Windows Forms</strong>: Utilized for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with users easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Hashing Algorithms</strong>: The project supports multiple cryptographic hashing algorithms such as SHA-256, MD5, etc., to provide different levels of encryption security.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How to Use:</h2>

<h3>Text Encryption:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter the text you want to encrypt in the "Plain Text" section.</li>
        <li>Select the desired encryption hash algorithm.</li>
        <li>Click on the "Encrypt" button to generate the encrypted text, which will appear in the "Encrypted Text" section.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Text Decryption:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter the encrypted text in the "Encrypted Text" section.</li>
        <li>Click on the "Decrypt" button to convert it back to the original plain text.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Change Hash Algorithm:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Select a new hashing algorithm from the dropdown menu to change the encryption format.</li>
        <li>The new algorithm will immediately affect both the encryption and decryption processes.</li>
    </ul>
